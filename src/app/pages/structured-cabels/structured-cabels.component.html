                <p>Indoor Horizontal Symmetrical Twisted-Pair Cable For Digital Communications UTP Category 5, in short,
                    UTP CAT5(HSYV5), is a type of multimedia cable for transmission and communication services, such as
                    data and voice information. It is widely used in broadband access projects such as broadband user
                    networks. Its quality is directly related to the transmission quality of information communication.

                <p>UTP CAT6 (HSYV6) is determined by a new performance evaluation index. It adopts 23AWG bare copper as
                    the conductor, polyethylene-based polymer material as the insulator. Its outer sheath material is
                    made of flame-retardant polymer material, and different colors are available. The twisted pair is in
                    line with the international requirements of ISO/IEC, the electrical characteristics exceed the
                    requirements of the six categories (Cat.6) international specifications. The center cross isolation
                    ensures NEXT performance and reasonable construction bending radius.</p>

                <P>UTP CAT6A (HSYVP6A) is designed to support the higher frequencies required for 10 Gigabit Ethernet
                    network transmissions and is still compatible with current needs. In addition to meeting EIA/TIA
                    568-B.2-1 and ISO/IEC 11801:2002 Category 6 requirements, it is also shielded that can immune to
                    cable crosstalk and other external electromagnetic interference.</P>

                <p>GYFTY53 uses a Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) as central strength member 
                    to provides anti-electromagnetic interference property. 
                    The armored structure protects the cable from rat bite and moisture proof. 
                    The tubes (and fillers) are stranded around the strength member into a 
                    compact and circular core. Then the cable core is covered with a 
                    thin polyethylene (PE) inner sheath, which is filled with jelly to 
                    protect it from water ingress. A layer of water-blocking material is
                     applied around the cable core to prevent water ingress. 
                     It can be used for duct and direct buried application, 
                    suitable for frequent lightning area and anti-electric field.</p>
