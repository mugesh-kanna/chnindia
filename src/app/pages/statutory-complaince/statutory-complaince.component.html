                <p>Compliance is not a revenue-generating function of a business. However, it is a component of successfully managing occupational risk and executing business strategies. Compliance outsourcing service is a function of business associated with compliance, which is being transferred to a third party vendor or provider located offshore rather than in-house compliance department.</p>
                <p>Every organization must comply with the employment law, rules and regulations where they are based. HR compliance outsourcing plays an important role to achieve all these standards. Compliance outsourcing takes a proactive approach to ensure that an organization meets all of its legal obligations.</p>
